<h1>About This Site</h1>

<div>
  <p>For this project, two data sources were selected to create a simulated parking ticket site that
  records tickets issued in Winnipeg. The first data source comes from the City of Winnipeg Open Data
  Portal, particularly the "Parking Ticket" dataset. This data was extracted in a .csv file (limited to 1000 records)
  and utilized for extraction to various database tables. The Parking Tickets dataset outlines the type of violation that
  occurred, the streets on which parking tickets were issued, the date they were issued on, the discounted fine, the full fine
  to be paid and points that can be used for mapping data. All data except the points for mapping was used on the site.
  The second data source that was selected was from Faker. This data was used to fake data of police officerâ€™s names that
  issued these tickets, and it was also used to fake a unique code which was used as parking ticket numbers. </p>
  <p>
    With both datasets combined, this website will inform anyone browsing it for information of parking tickets issued
    in Winnipeg, on which streets, the dates the tickets were issued, the associated fines, the police officer that issued
    that ticket and  the type of violation that occurred.
  </p>

  The database for this site holds 5 tables, namely: Tickets, Officers, Streets, Street_Categories and Categories.
  The Tickets table contains all the details about the tickets issued including: the ticket number, date, discounted fine,
  full fine,  related officer id and related street. The Officers table contains the  names of 200 officers. The Streets
  table contains the name of the streets on which the tickets were issued. The Categories table contains the name of all
  the violations that occurred. The Street_Categories table is a join table that represents a many to many relationship
  between streets and categories, it contains data to show all the streets that a violation occurred on and all the violations
  that occurred on a street, which is represented by the street_id and category_id.
